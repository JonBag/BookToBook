            <h2>Loam Soil</h2>
            <p>Loam soil is a balanced mixture of sand, silt, and clay. It is considered the ideal soil for most plants because it retains moisture and nutrients well while allowing excess water to drain away.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="soil-type">
            <h2>Clay Soil</h2>
            <p>Clay soil is rich in nutrients but can be heavy and compacted. It retains water well but can become waterlogged. Adding organic matter can improve its structure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="soil-type">
            <h2>Sandy Soil</h2>
            <p>Sandy soil has large particles and drains quickly. It is low in nutrients and doesn't retain moisture well. Adding organic matter can help improve its fertility.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="soil-type">
            <h2>Silty Soil</h2>
            <p>Silty soil has fine particles and retains moisture well. It is fertile and good for growing a variety of plants, but it can become compacted easily.</p>
